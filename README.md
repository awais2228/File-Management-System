## Simple File Management System

A C++-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) project that simulates a basic file management system — built to demonstrate core operating system concepts like file handling, compression, encryption, process tracking, and memory simulation.

## Features

- Create/Delete Files & Directories
- Read and Write to `.txt` files
- Encrypt/Decrypt using 4 algorithms:
  - Caesar Cipher
  - XOR Cipher
  - Vigenère Cipher
  - Rail Fence Cipher
- Compress/Decompress files using Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
- Simulated Memory Allocation
- Simulated Process Execution with Status Tracking
- CLI-based interaction, similar to a basic terminal

## How to Build

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio 2019 or 2022**
2. Make sure C++17 is enabled (`/std:c++17`)
3. Set platform to **x64**
4. Build and run the project (main.cpp is the entry point)
